#  House Price Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project aims to predict house sale prices using Machine Learning techniques.  
The model analyzes property features such as area, rooms, and other housing attributes to estimate the final sale price.

## Objective
To build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on historical housing data.


##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Dataset
The dataset contains various house-related features including:

- Lot Area
- Number of Bedrooms
- Overall Quality
- Year Built
- Neighborhood
- Sale Price (Target Variable)

## Project Workflow

### 1️ Data Loading
- Imported dataset using Pandas

### 2️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked dataset shape & structure
- Analyzed data types
- Visualized correlations
- Identified missing values

### 3️ Data Cleaning
- Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Id)
- Handled missing values
- Processed categorical features

### 4️ Feature Engineering
- Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables

### 5️ Train-Test Split
- Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%)

### 6️ Model Building
Trained multiple regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 7️ Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

##  Results
Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance with the lowest prediction error.

##  Key Learnings
- Importance of data preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Comparing ML models
- Evaluating regression performance

## Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Feature importance visualization
- Deployment using Flask / Streamlit
