# 🏠 House Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict house sale prices using Machine Learning techniques.  
The model analyzes property features such as area, rooms, and other housing attributes to estimate the final sale price.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on historical housing data.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset contains various house-related features including:

- Lot Area
- Number of Bedrooms
- Overall Quality
- Year Built
- Neighborhood
- Sale Price (Target Variable)

---

## 🔎 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading
- Imported dataset using Pandas

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked dataset shape & structure
- Analyzed data types
- Visualized correlations
- Identified missing values

### 3️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., Id)
- Handled missing values
- Processed categorical features

### 4️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Applied One-Hot Encoding for categorical variables

### 5️⃣ Train-Test Split
- Split dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%)

### 6️⃣ Model Building
Trained multiple regression models:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### 7️⃣ Model Evaluation
Evaluated models using:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)

---

## 📉 Results
Random Forest Regressor achieved the best performance with the lowest prediction error.

---

## ✅ Key Learnings
